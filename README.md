In the provided document, a *Security Threat and Risk Assessment* (STRA) is performed. This was my first time making a STRA and as such several sources were utilized, these are referenced in the foot notes. 

In addition to the STRA, we provide a low level analysis of each step we took, including those that were not successful and provide rationale for each of these decisions.
